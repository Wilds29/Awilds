<p>The Reason i enjoy fighting games so much is because its 1v1. There is no blaming teammates or anything like that which you would find commonly in games like League of Legends. Also, the games have a lot of depth so the learning process never truly ends
    The combination of depth, flashiness and difficulty lead to satisfying moments that other games don't give me. Hitting a combo or technique in game after practicing for hours is the best and the reason its become my go to genre to play.
